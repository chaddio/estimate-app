This is a heavy jquery app I created with Codeigniter PHP Framework, this was my last professional 'Full Stack' app I worked on. Currently been working with AngularJS + ZF2/Apigility API

Live Demo @ http://estimate.chaddio.com, use 'joe@joe.com' as user, password is 'joe!' 
Past Estimates (PDF Generated) will not display due to signature files not being there. 

Building a 'New Estimate' is where all the jquery/ajax happens. Feel free to create an estimate!
