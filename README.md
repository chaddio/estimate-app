This is a heavy jquery app I created with Codeigniter PHP Framework, this was my last professional 'Full Stack' app I worked on. Currently been working with AngularJS + ZF2/Apigility API

Building a 'New Estimate' is where all the jquery/ajax happens. Feel free to create an estimate!
If you use a touchscreen device (e.g. iPad, iPhone, etc), it uses a plugin to capture touch signature as well

Live Demo @ http://estimate.chaddio.com, use 'joe@joe.com' as user, password is 'joe!' 
Sorry, PDF generation is currently not working as my PHP doesn't have GD
